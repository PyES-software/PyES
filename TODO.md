TODO:
[x] Report calculated ionic strength in any case
[x] Report mean I and errors for potentiometry
[] Collect fields for saving/loading programmatically (has it is done for inputTitrationOpt widget, probably consider creating a class for widget with this functionality)
[] Constrain between parameters, possibly with scrollable combobox
[] Consider slope for other ISE (ion selective electrodes)
[] Consider giving T has a global potentiometry parameter
[x] Format the iteration report
[] Report in output potentiometry parameters for each titration
[] Compute uncertanties in percentages
[] Allow selection of multiple pX intervals from input
[x] Allow ignoring some points of potentiometry optimization
[] Variable ionic strength calculations for potentiometry optimization (check needed changes in libeq)
