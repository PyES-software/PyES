TODO:
[x] Report calculated ionic strength in any case
[x] Report mean I and errors for potentiometry
[POSTPONED] Collect fields for saving/loading programmatically (has it is done for inputTitrationOpt widget, probably consider creating a class for widget with this functionality)
[POSTPONED] Constrain between parameters, possibly with scrollable combobox
[POSTPONED] Consider slope for other ISE (ion selective electrodes)
[POSTPONED] Consider giving T has a global potentiometry parameter
[x] Format the iteration report
[x] Report in output potentiometry parameters for each titration
[x] Compute uncertanties in percentages
[LIBEQ] Allow selection of multiple pX intervals from input
[x] Allow ignoring some points of potentiometry optimization
[LIBEQ] Variable ionic strength calculations for potentiometry optimization
[LIBEQ] Check error if single constant to optimize
[LIBEQ] Check error recovery return
[x] Rapid result monitoring
[x] Total Sigma for each iteration
